# Haskell_Is_Hard.AI
I am building a chatbot that behaves like a normal GPT but always adds offcolor jokes and complains about how hard Haskell is. 

This is built using Django Rest Framework and will be hosted on my website in the future, www.kwal.no.

Disclaimer: This is a chatbot built as an inside joke amongst friends. Depending on the topic, the jokes that the chatbot makes can be offensive. Use at your own discression!
